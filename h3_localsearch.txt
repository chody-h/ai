Local Search Homework

Part 1
1.    Suppose f(x) = − 3(x − 2)^2. At what value of x does f(x) take its maximum value?

2.    Suppose that we use gradient ascent (from page 131 and 132 of the book) to find the maximum of the function from problem 1. Let α = 0.1 and suppose that our first guess of the maximum is x = 0. What is our guess after one iteration of applying the equation at the top of page 132? What is our guess after two iterations of applying the algorithm?

3.    Compute the gradient of f(x,y) = 3x^2y^3 − x^2 + 5y^2 by computing the partial derivatives \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\). (See this link {http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative} for hints.)

4.    Suppose that we use gradient ascent (from page 131 and 132 of the book) to find the maximum of f(x,y) = − (x − 3)^2 − 5y^2 + 2xy. Let α = 0.05 and suppose that our first guess of the maximum is x = 0,y = 1. What is our guess after one iteration of applying the equation at the top of page 132? What is our guess after two iterations of applying the algorithm?

Part 2

The attached Local Search MATLAB code {https://facwiki.cs.byu.edu/cs470fall2011/index.php/Local_Search_MATLAB_code} has you play with various local search algorithms: hill-climbing, random restart hill-climbing, and beam-forming. The code is organized as follows:

§  hill climbing on a surface with one bump

§  hill climbing on a surface with more than one bump

§  random restart hill climbing on a surface with more than one bump

§  local beam search on a surface with more than one bump

Run the code so that you learn how hill-climbing, random restart hill-climbing, and local beam search differ. Then, answer the following questions:

1.    What is the probability that hill climbing will reach the maximum point on a surface with more than one bump? How does this probability depend on the footprint of the hill?

2.    When would you perform random restart hill-climbing rather than hill-climbing? How would you know which to run?

3.    What would happen if you changed the beam search algorithm so that it took the 10 best solutions instead of the 7 best? Why?

Don't include all of the plots generated from the MATLAB code, but if a print-out helps you answer the above questions then include the print-out with your homework.
